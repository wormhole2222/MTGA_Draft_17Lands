## Security, Verification & macOS Gatekeeper

Because this is a free, open-source community project, the application is not signed with a paid Apple Developer Certificate ($100/year). As a result, macOS and Windows SmartScreen will flag the application as an "Unidentified Developer."

To guarantee the integrity of your download, our GitHub Actions pipeline automatically generates a **SHA-256 Checksum** for every release. You can compare the hash of your downloaded file against the `.sha256` file listed on the [Releases page](https://github.com/unrealities/MTGA_Draft_17Lands/releases) to verify it has not been maliciously modified.

**Mac Users: Bypassing the "App is Damaged" or "Malware" prompt**
macOS actively quarantines unsigned apps downloaded from the internet. To run the app safely:

1. Open **Terminal** (Command + Space -> "Terminal").
2. Type `xattr -cr ` (make sure to include the space at the end!).
3. Drag and drop the `MTGA_Draft_Tool.app` from your Applications folder directly into the Terminal window.
4. Press **Enter**. You can now double-click the app to open it normally.

## Marquee Features

- **Compositional Brain (v5.5):** A custom tactical engine that calculates a 0-100 `VALUE` score for cards in your pack. It dynamically weights raw Z-Score power, color lane commitment, curve needs, and relative wheel probability to suggest optimal picks. Look for the ⭐ symbol for elite "Bomb" picks.
- **AI Monte Carlo Auto-Optimizer:** Click the "Auto-Optimize Deck" button to unleash a background simulation engine that mathematically tests different deck permutations (16 lands vs 17 lands, swapping out clunky 5-drops for efficient 2-drops) across 10,000 simulated games to find the perfect 40-card configuration.
- **Sealed Studio:** A fully interactive drag-and-drop workspace specifically tailored for Sealed deckbuilding. Features an AI Shell Generator that automatically builds the top 3 mathematically optimal deck variants for your specific pool (e.g., Best 2-Color, Greedy Splash, Aggro).
- **Automated Cloud Datasets:** The application uses a custom Cloud ETL Pipeline that compiles and distributes the latest 17Lands telemetry every day. When you open the app, it instantly syncs the data for active Arena events in the background so you never have to manually scrape data again. You can view the live dataset schedule [here](https://unrealities.github.io/MTGA_Draft_17Lands/).
- **Zero-Day Card Recognition:** Alternate art cards and basic lands now instantly display their correct names on release day by dynamically querying your local MTG Arena SQLite database for unknown IDs, completely eliminating the wait for third-party API updates.
- **Mini Mode:** Click the `Mini Mode` button to hide the main dashboard and display a compact, draggable, always-on-top window. Perfect for single-monitor setups or playing seamlessly over the Arena client.
- **Dynamic Columns:** You can customize the columns displayed in any table (Pack, Card Pool, Compare) by **Right-Clicking the column header**. Add specific 17Lands stats or remove ones you don't need. The app remembers your layout automatically.
- **Themes & Mana Flairs:** Under the `Theme` menu, you can select custom "Mana Flairs" (Forest, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Plains, Wastes) or fall back to your Native OS System theme.

## UI Navigation & Tabs

The application is structured into a collapsible Live Dashboard and several functional workspace tabs:

### Live Dashboard
- **Advisor Recommendations:** Explains the mathematical reasoning behind the top 3 cards in the current pack.
- **Live Pack:** Displays the cards currently offered to you with their tactical scores.
- **Seen Cards (Wheel Tracker):** Tracks cards you passed previously in the draft.
- **Sidebar:** Contains visual "Open Lane" Signal detection, your current Mana Curve, and your Pool Balance (Creatures/Spells/Lands). You can click on the headers of these panels to collapse them.
- **Two Card Combo Alerts:** A sidebar panel that watches the live pack and flags when a card offered to you combos with a card already in your pool, showing which drafted card(s) it pairs with. Combo pairings are defined per set, so the list grows as new ones are added.
- **Archetype Tracker:** A sidebar panel where you pick a target archetype from a dropdown and see live counts of the key cards you've drafted toward it (removal, fixing, payoffs, etc.). It also appears at the top of the Stats tab in **Mini Mode**. Each set has its own archetype definitions.

### Application Tabs
- **Datasets:** Manage, download, and update 17Lands card data locally. Provides detailed download summaries, including exactly how many MTGA cards were successfully matched with 17Lands telemetry data.
- **Card Pool:** View the cards you have drafted. Features a **"Switch to Visual View"** button to stack your cards into mana curve columns exactly like MTG Arena does.
- **Deck Builder:** A fully interactive deck construction environment combining Auto-Generation and manual Custom building. Features a 1-click **Auto-Lands** button, a sleek basics toolbar, and live deck size validation.
- **Comparisons:** Search and add multiple cards to directly compare their stats side-by-side.
- **Tier Lists:** Import and manage custom tier lists from the 17Lands API.

## Settings & Preferences

Access Settings via `File -> Preferences...`

- **Win Rate Format:** Switch the results for win rate fields (GIHWR, OHWR) between a Percentage (55.0%), a 5-point Rating scale, or Grades (A+ to F).
- **Deck Filter Format:** Switch the Deck Filter dropdown to display either color permutations (e.g., UB, BG) or guild/shard names (e.g., Dimir, Golgari).
- **UI Scale:** Increase or decrease the application text and image sizes globally (from 40% up to 250%). Perfect for smaller laptop displays or massive 4k monitors.
- **Highlight Row by Mana Cost:** Colors the background of table rows based on the card's color identity.
- **Auto-Switch Deck Filter to Best Colors:** When the filter is set to "Auto", the app tracks your picks and will automatically switch to displaying data for your confirmed color pair once your lane is identified.
- **Enable Draft Log Creation:** Records the draft step-by-step in a readable log file within the `./Logs` folder.

## File Locations

The application stores your settings and data in specific locations to ensure they persist across updates.

### Configuration (`config.json`)
The application looks for the configuration file in the following order:
1. **Local Folder:** If `config.json` exists in the same folder as the application, it is used (Portable Mode).
2. **System User Folder:**
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\MTGA_Draft_Tool\config.json`
   - **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/MTGA_Draft_Tool/config.json`
   - **Linux:** `~/.config/MTGA_Draft_Tool/config.json`

### Datasets & Logs
- Downloaded card data is stored in the `Sets` folder.
- Custom Tier lists are stored in the `Tier` folder.
- Application debug logs are stored in the `Debug` folder, and draft logs are in the `Logs` folder.
- Two card combo definitions live in the `Combos` folder and archetype definitions in the `Archetypes` folder (each organized per set).

## Tier Lists (API-Based)

MTGA_Draft_17Lands features integrated support for downloading and using 17Lands tier lists directly within the application.

1. Go to the **Tier Lists** tab in the application.
2. Enter the 17Lands tier list URL and a custom label, then click Download.
3. Once downloaded, **Right-Click** the header of any table (like the Live Pack table), go to `Add Column`, and select your new tier list!

---

## Signal Detection (Beta)

This feature attempts to identify "Open Lanes" by analyzing the cards passed to you during the draft.

- **How it works:** The tool scans every pack you see in **Pack 1** and **Pack 3**. It calculates a "Signal Score" for every card based on its quality (GIHWR) and how late you are seeing it compared to its Average Taken At (ATA).
- **The Table:** The "Open Lanes" bar chart in the sidebar sums up these scores. A High Score (20+) typically suggests a very open lane, meaning your neighbors are not drafting that color.

## Troubleshooting

### Known Issues
- **Missing cards after restarting Arena:** Arena creates a new log after every restart. The application cannot track cards picked prior to an Arena restart.

### Desyncs & Missed Picks
The application features robust crash-recovery and state persistence. If you close the app mid-draft (or MTG Arena crashes), simply reopening the app will instantly resume your draft exactly where you left off.

If the log file ever severely desyncs, click the **Reload** button in the main dashboard. This will wipe the application's current memory, rapidly re-read the entire log file from the beginning, and cleanly reconstruct your draft state.

### Arena Log Issues
If the application cannot detect an active event, click `File -> Read Player.log` and ensure the proper file is selected.

### Custom Installation Folders
If MTG Arena is installed in a non-standard directory (e.g., a secondary Steam library drive), the application might fail to automatically locate the local MTGA card database, causing dataset downloads to fail. To fix this, click `File -> Locate MTGA Data Folder...` in the top menu bar and select your custom `MTGA_Data` folder.

- `04-external-integrations.md`
- `05-server-etl-pipeline.md`

### Environment Setup

1. **Install Python 3.12**
2. **Install Poetry:** `pip install poetry`
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

### Running Tests

This project uses `pytest` with `pytest-cov` for unit testing.

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/
```

To run tests with coverage reporting:
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/ --cov=src
```

### Automated Releases & Version Management

This project uses a fully automated CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions. Creating a new public release is entirely frictionless.

The pipeline triggers **automatically whenever code is merged into the `master` or `main` branch.** It reads the version number from `src/constants.py` and `pyproject.toml`, generates the git tag, builds the macOS/Linux/Windows executables, and publishes them to the Releases page.

**The Workflow:**

1. On your feature branch, run the bump script:
   - **Patch Bump (+0.01):** `poetry run python bump_version.py`
   - **Major Bump (+1.0):** `poetry run python bump_version.py major`
   - **Manual Set:** `poetry run python bump_version.py --set 4.50`
2. The script will update your config files and ask: `Would you like to automatically commit and push these changes to your branch? (y/N)`
3. Type `y` and press **Enter**.
4. Go to GitHub and merge your Pull Request into your main branch. The release will build and publish automatically.

*(Note: If you merge code into main without bumping the version number, the pipeline will simply rebuild and update the executables on the existing release—perfect for hotfixes)*

### Building Locally

If you need to test binary builds locally on your own machine instead of using GitHub Actions:

- **macOS / Linux:** 
  ```bash
  poetry run pyinstaller main.spec --clean
  ```
- **Windows:** Compile the source code using `poetry run pyinstaller main.spec --clean`, then open `builder/Installer.iss` with [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php#stable) and click **Build -> Compile**.
